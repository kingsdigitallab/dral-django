    <h1>Accessibility Statement for Distant Reading across Languages</h1>
    
<div class="rich-text"><p>This website is the result of a small and exploratory research project which stemmed from Gabriele Salciute Civiliene’s PhD thesis on the critical interrogation of reductive epistemologies and practices of translation theories dependent on text quantification and computation. The content presented is not to be considered a finished product, but rather a prototype. Nonetheless, the development team based at King’s Digital Lab has made an effort to make the content accessible and/or offer accessible alternatives to all audiences.</p><p>This website is run by <a href="https://kdl.kcl.ac.uk/">King&#x27;s Digital Lab</a> (KDL). We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:</p><ul><li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li><li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li><li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li><li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li><li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li></ul><p>Within the limits of the complexity of the field of comparative translation studies and distant reading, we’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p><p><a href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/">AbilityNet</a> has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.</p><h2>How accessible this website is</h2><p>We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:</p><ul><li>you cannot skip to the main content when using a screen reader;</li><li>the visualisations are interactive, but not accessible by keyboard nor screen readers, for this reason we have provided static images with descriptive text as a fallback. It doesn&#x27;t substitute the full user experience, but provides similar content information. They are available in the <a href="../about/visuals/index.html">&#x27;visuals explained&#x27; section</a>.</li></ul><h2>What to do if you cannot access parts of this website</h2><p>If you need information on this website in a different format like accessible PDF, large print, easy read, audio recording or braille:</p><ul><li>email <a href="mailto:kdl-info@kcl.ac.uk">kdl-info@kcl.ac.uk</a></li></ul><p>We&#x27;ll consider your request and get back to you in <b>15</b> days.</p><h2>Reporting accessibility problems with this website</h2><p>We&#x27;re always looking to improve the accessibility of our websites. If you find any problems not listed on this page or think we&#x27;re not meeting accessibility requirements, contact KDL via email:</p><p>email <a href="mailto:kdl-info@kcl.ac.uk">kdl-info@kcl.ac.uk</a></p><p>Please include as many details as you can, such as a link to every page where the issue is occurring and screenshots or other supporting media, whenever possible.</p><h2>Enforcement procedure</h2><p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, <a href="https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/">contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)</a>.</p><h2>Technical information about this website&#x27;s accessibility</h2><p>KDL is committed to making its websites accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p><p>This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.</p><h2>Non accessible content</h2><p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p><h3>Non compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3><p>The individual visualisations displayed in the <a href="../visualisations/index.html">visualisations section</a> are not navigable with keyboards nor screen readers.</p><p>We plan to create visualisations in an accessible format if the project receives sufficient funding for a new research phase.</p><h3>Disproportionate burden</h3><h4>Interactive tools and transactions</h4><p>We believe the cost of adding accessible interaction to the existing visualisations now would be a <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/7/made">disproportionate burden</a> within the meaning of the accessibility regulations. We will make another assessment if more funding becomes available. At present, no extra funding was sought for the project. The website as such should be considered a prototype.</p><h2>How we tested this website</h2><p>This website was last tested on 3 October 2019. The test was carried out by KDL.</p><p>We tested:</p><ul><li>the &#x27;homepage&#x27; at <a href="https://dral.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/">https://dral.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/</a></li><li>the &#x27;about the project&#x27; page at <a href="https://dral.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/about/">https://dral.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/about/</a></li><li>the &#x27;visualisations&#x27; landing page at <a href="https://dral.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/visualisations/">https://dral.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/visualisations/</a></li><li>relative omissions visualisation at <a href="https://dral.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/visualisations/?viz=relative_omission&amp;chapter=benjy,dilsey&amp;sort=frequency&amp;freq-min=0&amp;repeteme=ALL&amp;text=lt,pol,ru">https://dral.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/visualisations/?viz=relative_omission&amp;chapter=benjy,dilsey&amp;sort=frequency&amp;freq-min=0&amp;repeteme=ALL&amp;text=lt,pol,ru</a></li><li>JSON output at <a href="https://dral.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/visualisations/?viz=json&amp;chapter=benjy,dilsey&amp;sort=frequency&amp;freq-min=0&amp;repeteme=ALL&amp;text=lt,pol,ru">https://dral.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/visualisations/?viz=json&amp;chapter=benjy,dilsey&amp;sort=frequency&amp;freq-min=0&amp;repeteme=ALL&amp;text=lt,pol,ru</a></li></ul><p>We used <a href="https://siteimprove.com/en/core-platform/integrations/browser-extensions/">Siteimprove Accessibility Checker plugin</a> to assess compliance with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">WCAG</a> and tested the above pages with built-in assistive technology for people who are blind or have low vision.</p><p>This statement was prepared on 3 October 2019. It was last updated on 7 October 2019.</p><p></p><p>This page is based on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sample-accessibility-statement/sample-accessibility-statement-for-a-fictional-public-sector-website">sample template provided by gov.uk</a>.</p></div>
